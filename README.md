What is a neural network?

A neural network is a type of machine learning algorithm that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It is made up of interconnected nodes, called neurons, which process information and communicate with each other. Neural networks can be trained to perform a wide variety of tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing, and machine translation.

Neural networks work by learning from data. When a neural network is trained, it is given a set of input data and the corresponding output data. The neural network then adjusts the weights of the connections between its neurons until it is able to accurately predict the output data for any given input data.

Once a neural network has been trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data that it has never seen before. For example, a neural network that has been trained to recognize images can be used to identify the objects in a new image.
