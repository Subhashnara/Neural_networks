Keras

Keras is a high-level API for TensorFlow that makes it easier to build and train machine learning models. Keras provides a number of pre-built layers and models, as well as a number of tools for customizing and training models. Keras is used by a wide range of machine learning practitioners, from beginners to experts.

Some of the key functionalities of Keras include:

Building and training machine learning models
Pre-built layers and models
Customizing and training models

SGD

SGD stands for stochastic gradient descent. It is an optimization algorithm that is commonly used to train machine learning models. SGD works by iteratively updating the model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function.

Some of the key functionalities of SGD include:

Training machine learning models
Updating model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function
Preventing overfitting
ToCategorical

The to_categorical function converts labels to one-hot encoding. One-hot encoding is a way of representing categorical data as a vector of binary values. Each element of the vector represents a category, and the value is 1 if the data point belongs to that category and 0 otherwise.

One-hot encoding is commonly used in machine learning to represent categorical data as input to models.

Model

The Model class represents a machine learning model in Keras. It provides a number of methods for building and training models.

Dense

The Dense layer is a fully connected layer. It takes a vector as input and produces a vector as output. Dense layers are commonly used in machine learning to learn complex relationships between the input and output data.

Activation

The Activation layer applies a non-linear activation function to the input data. Activation functions are commonly used in machine learning to add non-linearity to models and improve their performance.

Input

The Input layer defines the input shape of a model. It is required for all Keras models.

Optimizer

The Optimizer class represents an optimization algorithm that is used to train machine learning models. The SGD class is one example of an Optimizer class.
